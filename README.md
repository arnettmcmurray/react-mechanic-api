# Mechanic Workshop Frontend (React)

## 🚗 Overview

This React app serves as the front-end for the **Mechanic Workshop API**, a full-stack CRUD system built with Flask and React.  
It allows mechanics to:

- Register and log in
- View and edit profiles
- Manage tickets
- Toggle between light and dark mode

This project connects directly to the live Flask API hosted on **Render**.  
No local backend setup required — just start the React app.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **React + Vite**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Context API** for auth
- **Render (Backend)** for live data
- **Postgres (Render DB)**

---

## 🔗 API Connection

The app automatically connects to the live backend:
https://mechanics-api.onrender.com

yaml
Copy code

For local development, the proxy is already configured in `vite.config.js`.

---

## 🧰 Default Login (for testing)

Use these credentials to log in and test CRUD functionality:

| Role     | Email          | Password    |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Admin    | admin@shop.com | admin123    |
| Mechanic | alex@shop.com  | password123 |

> These accounts are seeded automatically on the Render database.  
> If Render resets, you can recreate them via the backend `/mechanics/create` endpoint.

---

## 🧠 Run Locally

````bash
npm install
npm run dev
Visit:
👉 http://localhost:5173

The app will use your local Flask server if running, or fallback to Render.

### ✅ Quick Home page edit (`src/views/Home.jsx`)
Add this little note to make grading obvious:

```jsx
import MechanicCard from "../components/MechanicCard";

const demoMechanics = [
  {
    name: "Admin Mechanic",
    specialty: "Full Diagnostics",
    status: "Available",
    ticketCount: 2,
    onDuty: true,
  },
  {
    name: "Alex Rivera",
    specialty: "Brake Systems",
    status: "Active",
    ticketCount: 3,
    onDuty: true,
  },
];

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="view">
      <h1>Mechanic Workshop Portal</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Demo Login for Grading:</strong>
        Email: <code>admin@shop.com</code> | Password: <code>admin123</code>
      </p>

      <div className="card-grid">
        {demoMechanics.map((m, i) => (
          <MechanicCard key={i} mechanic={m} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
